In this experiment (results of which are in experiment1.png) we tested mcts_vanilla against itself at various tree sizes.
We found that win rate generally increased with tree size, but did so with diminishing returns.
I.E. tree size 50 vs. 100 is very bad, but 200 vs. 100 is not as great an improvement.
